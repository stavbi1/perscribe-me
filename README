## How to run

1. install dependencies from requirements.txt
2. run main.py
3. go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## caveats
1. When adding a medication to a prescription, it validates it against the clinical tables API,
and only adds it if the name and dosage given are exactly the same
2. A medication's code is determined by the a combination of the name and the dosage given
3. When closing a prescription, a `warning` object is returned with every interaction description that exists between every
medication with itself or with another one in the following structure:

`
interactions: {
        [drug_code1 + drug_code2]:  warnings[]
    }
`

4. I didn't have much time for testing it and check for edge cases
